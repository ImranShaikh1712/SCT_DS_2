# SCT_DS_2
# 📊 Netflix Movie Ratings Analysis

This project is part of my Data Science Internship with **SkillCraft Technology**.  
The goal is to analyze and visualize synthetic Netflix movie data using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## 📁 Task 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In this task, I created a simulated dataset of Netflix movies and performed an EDA to discover insights on:

- 🎬 Genre distribution
- ⭐ Movie rating trends
- 🎥 Runtime vs Rating correlation
- 🌍 Country and Language patterns
- 🔝 Top 10 most viewed Netflix movies
